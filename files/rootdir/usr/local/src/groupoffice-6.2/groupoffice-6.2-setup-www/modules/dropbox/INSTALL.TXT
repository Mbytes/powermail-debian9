To enable Dropbox for a Group-Office installation a couple of things need to be done.

1. As a user that has "manage" permissions for the dropbox module, go to "Settings"=>"Dropbox sync" and click on the "Settings" button located on that tab.

2. Go to the website "https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps" and create an app for Group-Office.
	 - Make sure that you have also provided a correct "Redirect URI" in the app creation screen, otherwise the module will not work.
   - Also provide a correct "Webhook URI" in the app creation screen. This is used to send notifications about Dropbox changes back to Group-Office.

2. The generated App key and App secret need to be filled in in the "settings" dialog.

3. Save the settings and click on "OK" to close the settings dialog.

4. Group-Office will now reload and the dropbox app will be configured.

========================

Now every user that wants to start syncing to Group-Office will need to login into Group-Office and then click on the "Connect" button that can be found
in "Settings"=>"Dropbox sync".

Then the user will be redirected to the Dropbox website to login with their dropbox account and when that's finished they need to explicitly grant Group-Office
to connect with their Dropbox account.
When that's done, the screen can be closed and Group-Office is connected to Dropbox.

The sync will be handled by a cronjob and the Dropbox folder in the user's file module will be created upon first sync.
